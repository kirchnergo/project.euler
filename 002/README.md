# Problem 2



> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> ```1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... ```

> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
